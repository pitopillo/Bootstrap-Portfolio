            <p>Greetings,</p>
 <p>My name is Noel Alvarez but go by Barney. I am originally from Ponce, Puerto Rico but have lived in Orlando, Florida for most of my live by now I consider myself a certified Floridian. I have been happily married for 8 years to my wife Kathy and we have been blessed to have two beautiful children Sarai Victoria (4 years old) and Malakai Josiah (9 months old). I currently work for Jp Morgan Chase as a Business Analyst for the Performance Operations Unit my main function is to analyze the performance of our different lines of business and point to areas of opportunity.</p>
 <p>Some of my interest include playing basketball, video games, running, and I love to spend time with family and serving at my church. My daughter loves to challenge me at Uno's on a daily basis most of the time she cheats or I let her win but on those rare occassions when daddy wins I teach her the importance of good sportsmanship. My family drives me to do better for them and myself they are the driving force behind me. I live by the believe that God comes first and foremost as he is the provider of life itself and everything comes from Him. Without God I wouldn't have been blessed with such a beautiful family.</p>
